Most popular IDEs:
1.Visual Studio:
	Visual Studio has an advantage when it comes to programming. This IDE is mostly used by corporate programmers 
to produce .NET code.

2.Eclipse:
	This is the best alternative if you are not a big fan of Microsoft’s Visual Studio. The interface is a lot cleaner 
and concise than Visual Studio and the languages that are possible to use extend past the .Net Framework.

3.Netbeans:
	The is the number one alternative to Eclipse. This program is extensible and free, and it compiles code which is 
a bonus. When installing Netbeans it comes with a Java server called GlassFish that you could deploy on your computer 
for your testing environment. 

4.Kate:
	Kate is exactly how the website describes it, a text editor. Not to be looked down upon as it does a lot more 
than a regular text edit can do and that is what makes this an indispensable product.

5.gedit:
	gedit is the official editor of the gnome desktop and comes installed once the system is setup. 
Very useful for the user that is casually editing code and not undertaking major projects.
