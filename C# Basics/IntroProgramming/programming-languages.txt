Most popular programming languages:
1.C++	
	- C++ is regarded as a mid-level language. This indicates that C++ comprises a combination of both 
high-level and low-level language features. C# is designed specifically to work with the .Net and is geared to the modern 
environment of Windows and mouse-controlled user interface, networks and the internet.

2.C
	- C is a relatively small language (in terms of keywords etc) and is no object oriented whereby 
both C++ and C# are OO.

3.Java
	- Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, strongly, and manifestly typed, 
both are class-based object-oriented, both are designed with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation.

4.PHP
	- PHP generates directly the HTML / JS / CSS used to compose the page and produce the end HTML page 
directly from the code.

5.JavaScript
	- Javascript is a non-typed scripting language, which means it typically runs uncompiled in browsers. 
C# is a strongly-typed language, which is typically compiled into a .dll.
